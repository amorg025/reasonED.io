            High school graduates are not prepared with the skills necessary to
            identify logical fallacies in an increasingly online world.
          </h3>
          <br /><br />

        <p>In this digital era, where the internet serves as a vast source of information, 
            the need for sound critical thinking skills is more significant than ever. However, with the 
            abundance of online content, we face a pressing societal challenge: the prevalence of logical fallacies, 
            misinformation, and a lack of emphasis on critical reasoning skills. </p>

        <p>A report titled “Teaching Critical Thinking in K-12” noted that among 4th-grade teachers, 86% emphasized 
            teaching deductive reasoning, but this figure sharply declines to a mere 39% among 8th-grade teachers when
             expressing the same sentiment. Moreover, in a 2019 global survey conducted by Cambridge, 50% of teachers indicated 
             they do not have enough time to effectively teach these skills, and only 21% of teachers agreed that they possess 
             all the necessary resources to cultivate these skills. Educators often find themselves unable to effectively teach 
             critical reasoning.</p>

        <p>Many existing curriculums do not include adequate resources for teaching logical fallacies. If educators wish to emphasize 
            these concepts, they must spend time either creating their own materials or searching through the internet to find potential 
            tools. Then arises another challenge: if the resources are not reusable over the course of the year, students will not develop
             adequate skills, and if there are not similar resources across grade levels, students will forget the material and fail to build 
             on the skills they have acquired.  Only if all of these elements come together will students be fully supported to build their 
             skills in logical fallacy detection.  </p>

        <p>An optimal solution should account for these common pitfalls by having resources that are both reusable in a way that still builds on
             fallacy identification skills and curated for multiple grade levels ranging from elementary to high school. As educators lack the time
              needed to create their own resources, a solution must emphasize ease of use by being quick for educators to set up and easy to guide 
              students through. Team Crystal is proposing a software solution: <b>ReasonED.io</b> </p>

          <h3 class="mb-3" data-aos="fade-up">About ReasonED</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            ReasonED.io will be a game-based learning website that improves the ability of users to identify logical fallacies through simple, age-appropriate games. 
            The website will host an elementary school collection of games, a middle school collection of games, a high school collection of games, and an adult collection
             of games, respectively. They will all share the same goal of introducing and improving logical fallacy identification skills, but the difficulties and approaches
              will vary depending on the age group.  The fallacy characters serve as memorable guides in this educational journey. This website will provide educators with a
              tool to cultivate their student’s critical thinking skills over the long-term and beyond the scope of a single subject.</p>

            <p>One game series that the website will host is one in which each game revolves around a logical fallacy personified as a fun character with a unique quirk.
                 The character will encounter different disagreements (e.g. disagreement with another character) that they need to respond to. All but one of the potential 
                 responses will be a logical fallacy corresponding to the character. Players must help the characters choose valid responses to progress the game. Each game 
                 in this series will be curated for elementary, middle, and high school students through changes to the complexity of the scenarios and responses. A few of
                the games in this series will be: </p>

            <p><b>Straw Manny:</b> This character is always building straw houses that keep falling down. Players need to help Straw Manny find the best materials to build a sturdy 
                house, teaching the concept of the "straw man" fallacy.</p> 
            <p><b>Hasty Harry:</b> Harry is always in a rush to make decisions. Players must help him collect all the puzzle pieces before he rushes to complete the puzzle, 
                teaching the "hasty generalization" fallacy.</p>
                <p><b>Slipery Slope Sally:</b> Sally often jumps to extreme conclusions. Players need to guide her safely down a winding path without letting her slip into a 
                    pitfall, introducing the “slippery slope” fallacy.</p>

            <p>While the concepts and scenarios are simplified for younger ages, these games aim to plant the seeds of critical thinking and encourage kids to recognize flawed reasoning. The fallacy characters serve as memorable guides in this educational journey. This website will provide educators with a
            tool to cultivate their student’s critical thinking skills over the
            long-term and beyond the scope of a single subject.</p>

                <p>
                  <b>Confirmation Bias</b> - A cognitive bias that involves
                  seeking, interpreting, and remembering information that
                  confirms one’s preconceptions (American Psychological
                  Association n.d.). <br /><br />
                  <b>Critical Thinking</b> - The ability to think clearly and
                  rationally, understanding the logical connection between ideas
                  and the ability to make reasoned judgements (American
                  Psychological Association n.d.). <br /><br />
                  <b>Fact-Checking</b> - The process of verifying the accuracy
                  of claims made in public discourse and journalism (Cambridge
                  English Dictionary n.d.).<br /><br />
                  <b>False Dilemma</b> - A fallacy that presents a limited set
                  of options as the only possible choices when there may be
                  other alternatives (Excelsior OWL n.d.). <br /><br />
                  <b>Logical Fallacy</b> - An error in reasoning or a flawed
                  argument that can make an argument appear valid when it is not
                  (Nikolopoulou, 2023). <br /><br />
                  <b>Misinformation</b> - False or inaccurate information
                  shared, often unintentionally, without the intent to deceive
                  (Dictionary.com n.d.).<br /><br />
                  <b>Disinformation </b> - False information deliberately spread
                  to deceive or mislead others (Dictionary.com n.d.).
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>Slippery Slope</b> - A fallacy that suggests one small step
                  will inevitably lead to a chain of related events, often with
                  exaggerated consequences (Excelsior OWL n.d.). <br /><br />
                  <b>Straw Man Argument</b> - A fallacy that involves
                  misrepresenting an opponent’s argument to make it easier to
                  attack and refute (Excelsior OWL n.d.).
